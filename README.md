# usage
Download a release from the [releases tab](https://github.com/matortheeternal/zedit/releases) and install or extract it, then run `zEdit.exe`.

# development
This is a github repository.  If you want to help with development you'll need to [clone it](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) using `git` from the command line or a Git GUI client.  If you're going to use a Git GUI client I recommend [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/).

zEdit is a Windows x64 NodeJS Electron application.  Install [NodeJS LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) **64-bit**, then start a terminal/command prompt in the application directory and run `node -v` and `npm -v`.  The output should be v8.11.x and 5.6.x or newer.  If you get anything else you probably have multiple installations of node which you'll need to sort out.

Before installing node modules you need to tell NodeJS where Python is so it can build certain native dependencies.  Install [python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)\* and [add an environmental variable](https://kb.wisc.edu/cae/page.php?id=24500) `PYTHON` set to the full path to `python.exe`.  E.g. `C:\dev\lang\Python27\python.exe`.  Restart your command prompt and test the environmental variable by typing `echo %PYTHON%`.

You will also need to install the `windows-build-tools` package.  Run `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools` in an elevated command prompt to do so.

Clone zEdit and run `npm install` in an elevated command prompt in its directory.  This will install required node modules and dependencies.  You will also need to run `npm run rebuild` to rebuild the xelib native node addon to work with Electron.

Initialize submodules with `git submodule update --init`, and install gulp with `npm i gulp-cli -g`.

You can then run the application with `npm start`.  You can build a release of the application using `npm run release`. 

NOTE: If you get `Error: Electron failed to install correctly`, simply delete the `node_modules\electron` folder if present and run `npm install` again.  You can also try `npm install electron` if this doesn't work.
