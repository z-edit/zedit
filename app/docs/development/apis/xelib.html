<p><b>xelib</b> is a JavaScript wrapper around XEditLib.dll.  XEditLib.dll is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic-link_library">dynamic-link library</a> which provides an API to use the XEdit framework.</p>

<h2>Namespaces</h2>
<p>All members are top-level in xelib.  This choice was made to simplify and shorten code which calls xelib functions.</p>

<p>Below is an overview of the namespaces in xelib.  You can click on a namespace to view the functions in it.</p>

<table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Namespace</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr ng-repeat="child in topic.children">
        <td class="nowrap">
            <a ng-click="$emit('navigateToChild', child)">{{::child.label}}</a>
        </td>
        <td>{{::child.description}}</td>
    </tr>

<h2>Important Concepts</h2>

<h3>Elements</h3>

<p>With xelib and the XEdit framework, everything in plugin files (including the files themselves) is an element.  In zEdit's GUI, every row in the tree view and every row in the record view is an element.  Elements can be files, groups, records, structs (a collection of a specific set of elements), arrays (a collection of some number of a single type of element), or values.  Elements always have certain things, such as a name and a value.</p>

<h3>Paths</h3>

<p>Several functions in xelib make use of paths.  Paths are strings which describe how to reach an element from another element, or from the root.  Parts of a path are separated by the backslash <code>\</code>, which needs to be escaped in javascript code (e.g. <code>\\</code>).</p>

<h3>Handles</h3>

<p>XEditLib.dll returns "handles" to elements.  Handles are like pointers, but in the case of XEditLib they're integer IDs which correspond to entries in an internal store.  Handles should be released with <code>xelib.Release</code> once your code is finished using them.  There are several <b>Utility</b> functions which make working with handles easier.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> User scripts use a handle group so users don't have to worry about releasing handles created during script execution.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Handle <code>0</code> is a special reserved handle.  It emulates the "root" of the element tree when used with certain functions.</p>
