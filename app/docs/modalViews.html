<p>zEdit uses a lot of modal views - child views which display above the currrent view and disable any controls below them.</p>

<p>Modal views can be closed by:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Clicking the <b>X</b> in the upper right corner of the modal</li>
    <li>Clicking in the space outside of the modal.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> Some modal views cannot be closed.</p>
